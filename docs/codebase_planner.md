# Codebase Planner

## Overview

Codebase Planner is a comprehensive tool for project planning and visualization with an integrated chat interface. It combines the power of AI-driven planning with interactive diagrams and structured project views.

## Key Features

1. **Chat Interface**
   - AI-powered chat for project planning and management
   - Natural language processing for converting requirements into structured plans
   - Context-aware responses based on current project state

2. **Tree Structure View**
   - Hierarchical representation of project components
   - Expandable/collapsible nodes for easy navigation
   - Drag-and-drop functionality for reorganizing project structure
   - Real-time updates based on chat interactions

3. **Diagram Visualization**
   - Multiple diagram types (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, etc.)
   - Tabbed interface for different diagram perspectives
   - Integration with Mermaid.js for rendering diagrams
   - Export options for diagrams (PNG, SVG, HTML)

4. **Project Planning**
   - AI-assisted project planning and task breakdown
   - Resource allocation and timeline visualization
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Integration with project management tools

## Architecture

The application will be built using a modern web stack with the following components:

1. **Frontend**
   - React.js for UI components
   - Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Mermaid.js for diagram rendering
   - React Flow for interactive diagrams

2. **Backend**
   - Node.js/Express for API endpoints
   - Python for AI planning and diagram generation
   - WebSocket for real-time updates

3. **AI Components**
   - Integration with LLMs for chat and planning
   - Custom agents for different planning aspects
   - Diagram generation from natural language

## Integration with Existing Tools

The Codebase Planner will integrate with:

1. **GitDiagram** - For flow diagram generation
2. **PlanGen** - For AI-powered planning capabilities
3. **Clean-Coder-AI** - For project management features
4. **Plandex** - For project planning and structure

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up project structure and build system
   - Implement basic UI layout
   - Create chat interface component
   - Establish backend API endpoints

2. **Phase 2: Tree Structure View**
   - Implement hierarchical tree component
   - Create data structure for project representation
   - Add interaction capabilities (expand/collapse/edit)
   - Connect with backend for persistence

3. **Phase 3: Diagram Visualization**
   - Integrate Mermaid.js for diagram rendering
   - Implement tabbed interface for multiple diagrams
   - Create diagram generation service
   - Add export functionality

4. **Phase 4: AI Integration**
   - Connect chat interface with LLM
