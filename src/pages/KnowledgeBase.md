Goal - To Create a library of contextual items. Then to bundle them for example:
1 wewbsite 1 codebase 1 text file 2 youtube videos 5 codefiles - Bundled into single item "Context".  All this to be able to later on use item "Context" as contextual information when Q&A with agents, or requesting for task completion - so that they would have better comprehension.
